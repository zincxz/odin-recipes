            <ol>
                <h4>Dough:</h4>
                Place flour in a large mixing bowl; make a well in the center and add salt, beef fat, egg and enough warm water to make the dough smooth but not sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, but never more than 24 hours. Place the empanada dough on a lightly floured counter top. Roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Using a round 5 inch cookie cutter, cut the dough into circles.

                <h4>Filling:</h4>
            
                Heat the beef in a large pan. Add the onions and saute for 4 to 5 minutes or until softened. Add paprika and cook for 5 minutes. Add ground beef, stirring and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Add water (or beef broth) and cook for another 4 minutes and remove from heat. Add chili powder, cumin, green onions and eggs, mixing well. Cover and let rest until cool.

                <h4>To Assemble</h4>
                Preheat oven to 350F. Place 2 tbsp filling in the lower half of each circle of dough. Brush the edges of the crust with water, then fold the tow ends together; press the edges together with fingers. Brush the top of the empanada with 1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
