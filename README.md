This is Martin's first html project!
This will be my first "project" on TOP. This project will test the fundamental HTML skills we learned in the beginning stages of TOP. I will be using this project to test the following skills:
    boilerplate memorization
    heading
    paragraphs
    absolute and relative linking
    images
    bold and italics
    etc

After I am done with a run through, I will write a summary based on what skills came quick from learning and which ones I had to go back through and re-read to implement.
